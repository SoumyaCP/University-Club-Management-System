# UNIVERSITY CLUB MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## ðŸ“– About the Project
The University Club Management System (UCMS) is a web-based platform developed to streamline and digitalize the day-to-day operations of student clubs in a university environment. It provides an efficient, centralized interface for managing club events, members, announcements, and feedbackâ€”all in one place.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Managing student clubs manuallyâ€”tracking members, sending announcements, organizing eventsâ€”can be chaotic and inefficient. UCMS solves this by providing a digital tool that simplifies the workflow for both club administrators and members.

## Core Functionalities
**Event Management:**
Admins can create, edit, and view upcoming events. Each event has relevant details like date, description, and venue. This helps members stay updated on club activities.

**Member Management:**
New members can be added through a form, and a directory of existing members can be viewed. This simplifies communication, and role assignment within the club.

**Announcement System:**
Admins can post announcements that are visible to all members, making communication fast and uniform.

**Feedback Collection:**
A feedback form allows members to submit their thoughts, ideas, or concerns about the club events. This helps the administration improve club experiences over time.

**Authentication System:**
Basic login functionality ensures that only authorized users can manage backend operations like adding events or announcements.

**User-Friendly Interface:**
The system uses HTML, CSS, and JS for a clean and simple front end that makes it easy for users to interact with the system.
